### OR

a=14

b=7

print("The addition of",a,"and",b,"gives:",a+b) #addition

print("The subtraction of",a,"and",b,"gives:",a-b) #subtraction

print("The multiplication of",a,"and",b,"gives:",a*b) #multiplication

### (hint) total number of minutes in an year =No.of days in an year * Hours in a day * Minutes in an hour


## SCRIPT

days=365

minutes=60

hours=24

totalmins=days*hours*minutes

print("The total number of minutes can be found by multiplying-no of days in a year, minute in a hour and hours in a day")

print("The total number of minutes in a year=",totalmins)

## Exercise 10

### Name your file: PoundsToDollars.py
### Write a program that asks the user to enter an amount in pounds (£) and the program calculates and converts an amount in dollar ($)
### An example runs of the program:
### Please enter amount in pounds: XXX
### £ XXX are $ XXX

## SCRIPT

pounds=float(input("Enter the amount in pounds(£)"))

dollars=pounds*1.26 # Exchange rate is 1pound=1.26 dollars

print("£",pounds,"are","$",dollars)
